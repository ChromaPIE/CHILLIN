# <div align=center>CHILLIN</div>

## Preface

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always got my Spotify on and chill with a modpack where I put together mods I found from CurseForge and Modrinth. It's so much fun browsing the Latest Updated/Published tab and finding mods that fits the vibe, and voila, think I've made it to the right spot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modpack focuses on nothing, however it's made with one single thing in mind: No redundant stuff. I don't want *mainstream* biome mods like BYG or BOP to fill the REI tab with their repetitious blocks. And come on they be presenting in too many modpacks and I was already tired of them personally. Terralith was chosen instead. It's neat, it's new at least to me, and it's not gonna adding no blocks or items, enough for making your worlds look better. Also, though I want to walk around and explore stuff in the modpack, I don't want any mods described as *Adding new biomes, new weapons, new mobs, new dimension, new quests, new advancements, new adventure, new this ,new that* inside. Cuz bro why tho. I don't wanna fight the pouring sweat out of my whole face for nothing.

## Now it has:

- Nearly all mods/datapacks that I can find for Fabric 1.19.2 introducing a whole ocean of structures like ruins, houses, mansions, dungeons, etc., probably with loots inside.
- Some of the great furniture/decor mods if you wanna have a decent place to live that you don't actually have irl.
- Weapons from Minecraft Dungeons that's planned as collectibles.
- Fine-tuned third personal gameplay, achieved by a bunch of mods working perfectly with each other.
- Optimizing mods of your thought plus dope compatibility. Stable™ both on client & server side. No more copying and pasting your "Mods for all packs" folder into it and spending like 30 hours getting crashes and openning issues on 20 different repos. The job was already done here by me. Say less.
- Maxed-up QoL experience. If you feel like it, or anything mentioned above and below, is not enough, open an issue.
- Mad crazy ambient vibe. Suits best with your everyday pre-bed-time and your Spotify playlist you'd like to dive into for then. (I didn't put the Craftify mod in )
- Some cute animals, but not too many.
- Numismatic Overhaul that allows you to earn money from trading or killing illagers, and spend them to buy stuff from villagers, but I always caring about its potential. What it is now is way far from enough.
- Maybe more. Just plug and play it. You'll know.

## It doesn't have (so far):
- The Twilight Forest. Cuz it alway do the trick better than melatonin and it's pre-bed gaming time.
- Craftify mod. Cuz I can't afford a monthly Premium subscription with zero affiliate income. The mod is basically just a screen space occupier without controlling feature.
- Farmer's Delight. Though it do fits the idyllic vibe it gives that's not intended. You know what maybe I'll add the FD suite later.
- Taxes. Cuz Form 1040 mod is yet to be for Fabric. You Fabric simps are lucky.
- Modern Industrialization. Stop being addicted to GregTech. Actually this modpack is great for GregTech nerds bc least it's more similar to what the real world looks like. It might help you outta that.
- CraftTweaker/KubeJS/.... I don't want my Crafting Table to be made out of two dragon's heads and you do not too. Welp I have simply lost interest on coding on ZenScript or shit. The modpack's name CHILLIN doesn't just mean you should be chilling. I've *been chilling* putting pieces together too. Maybe later but just for enhancing the compat between mods.
- Quests or anything guiding. This is planned. I might make a guidebook using Modonomicon (Seems like a great mod. Go check it out.) and lead you in a trip through all mods that tweaks/provides new content to the modpack.

## Oh, and,
- The modpack is heavily in progress but I'll try my best not to corrupt your saves bc I'm not at all an author, I'm just sharing the modpack I be chilling with. I play and i modify it.
- Open issues, pull requests, anything. If you wanna add a mod, soon as it fits the vibe, let me know. If you updated the mods yourself and that caused a crash, report it. It's not usually allowed in other repos of modpacks but I promise I won't call you a moron or smth. I also make sure all the mods are up-to-date.
- When all the mods have published their releases for the next Minecraft version, we'll go forward too. If Fabric was slain by Quilt someday, we'll cheat on her too.
- The world won't look good if [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-reimagined) is not a thing. The config profile I use is also in the shaderpacks folder and you can make it look even better by turning options like rain puddles on (but not emissive ores! there are already resourcepacks doing the job and it looks way nicer), depending on your device.

## Current issues
The following are some known issues. Don't report unless you've figured out what is the cause.
- Physics Mod adds a button to its config screen to the pause menu, which makes a conflict with the volume sliders ClientTweaks adds to the pause menu that is overlapping, causing inconvenience both when clicking the Physics config button and adjusting the sliders. I've temporarily disabled the volume sliders until [the issue](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/ClientTweaks/issues/64) got fixed.
- Crash at very small chance, might be caused by Model Gap Fix. I've already replaced the mod with its alt Item Model Fix, hopefully it's no longer happening.
- The chain model for the lanterns to cling to surfaces became invisible at some point when a certain mod was included. I can't remember when it happened, I do not know which mod is to be blamed, I have zero idea why. I'm trying my best not to look straight at them cuz they look so fudging goofy.
- [This god damn issue](https://github.com/xiaocihua/stack-to-nearby-chests/issues/11). The temp solution was taken: disabling the buttons and turn to hotkeys for Stack To Nearby Chest to function.

## For fellas from China
- I stream on [Bilibili](http://live.bilibili.com/354585), not Twitch cuz it costs my entire bank account for a streaming-friendly proxy service. If there's no modpack that I like to mess around with I stream CHILLIN. I like chatting with chat but I'm no influencer, no one watches me streaming, so I don't talk much to a blank chat, so it might make you feel sleepy right away.
- The modpack has a language called 简体中文（Scratchery） built in. Scratchery is my very own locale project for mods in the modpacks I made to create a seamless and qualified experience for Simplified Chinese. Officially provided locales for zh_cn aren't always good and the ecosystem of CFPA nowadays is hilariously cringe so I decided to make my own. It's just to let you know. You can taste it by switching to the Scratchery language in the options, or let it overlap upon the official or CFPA one using the modified language selection screen, provided by Language Reload mod. However the default language will be en_us as always. Be adviced that Scratchery is being worked on slowly. Take it as nothing but a wishful thinking.

### **Have fun. Get chilled.**
